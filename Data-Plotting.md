### plot_iv(TES=None,offset=None,multi=False)
make a plot of an I-V curve, or multiple curves
 - if TES=None, all I-V curves are plotted on top of each other
 - if multi=True, a grid of plots is made, one for each TES
 - see also plot_iv_physical_layout() below

### plot_iv_physical_layout(xwin=True)
plot the I-V curves in thumbnails mapped to the physical location of each detector
 * the optional keyword xwin can be set to False and the plot will not appear on screen but will only be saved to a png file.
