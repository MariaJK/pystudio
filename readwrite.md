# Read and write FITS files with QUBIC data

read_fits(filename)

* ''filename'' is a string with the name of the file to be read.  The qubicpack object will then have the data in memory and can be used with the [plotting/analysis routines](plot-analysis).

write_fits()

* Do not provide a filename.  The name of the FITS file is generated by the qubicpack object.  It is based on the observation date.
