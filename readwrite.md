# Read and write FITS files with QUBIC data

### read_fits(filename)
* _filename_ is a string with the name of the file to be read.  The qubicpack object will then have the data in memory and can be used with the [plotting/analysis routines](plot-analysis).

### write_fits()
* Do not provide a filename.  The name of the FITS file is generated by the qubicpack object.  It is based on the observation date.

### read_filter()
* read a previously saved _filtersummary_ (see *filter_iv_all()* in the [plot/analysis section](plot-analysis).

### save_filter()
* save _filtersummary_ to a file.  Do not provide a filename.  The filename is determined by the observation date.
