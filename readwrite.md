# Read and write QUBIC data
Data from QUBIC lab measurements is in FITS format.  There is also the possibility to extract data to simple text column format (see iv2txt below).

### read_fits(filename)
_filename_ is a string with the name of the file to be read.  The qubicpack object will then have the data in memory and can be used with [analysis routines](Data-Analysis) and the [plotting routines](Data-Plotting).

### write_fits()
Do not provide a filename.  The name of the FITS file is generated by the qubicpack object.  It is based on the observation date.

### read_filter()
read a previously saved _filtersummary_ (see *filter_iv_all()* in the [analysis section](Data-Analysis).

### save_filter()
save _filtersummary_ to a file.  Do not provide a filename.  The filename is determined by the observation date.

### iv2txt(TES)
save the I-V data for a given TES to a text file with two columns containing the __Vtes__ and the __Ites__
